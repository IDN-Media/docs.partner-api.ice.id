# ICE Notification Service

ICE will send POST requests to your server, in which the body will be a JSON representation of the notification.\
Your server should return a 200 status code. Any other status code will be considered a failure by our backend.\
ICE will retry later (up to 5 times). The retries follow an [exponential backoff and jitter](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/exponential-backoff-and-jitter/) mechanism.\
After 5 retries, we will stop sending notifications and send you an email containing the event payload.
